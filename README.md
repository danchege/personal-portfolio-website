## Step 2: HTML Structure
- Designed the basic structure of the portfolio using semantic HTML elements.
- Added sections for the header, about me, projects, and contact information.

## Step 3: Styling with CSS
- Created a `style.css` file to define the visual appearance of the portfolio.
- Used CSS for layout, typography, and responsive design.

## Step 4: Adding Interactivity
- Wrote JavaScript in `script.js` to add interactivity, such as form validation or animations.

## Step 5: Content Population

## Future Improvements
